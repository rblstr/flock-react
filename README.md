# flock-react (redux-less branch)

This is a port of the Python project [Flock](https://github.com/rblstr/flock) to pure frontend JavaScript utilising [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). This is the 'redux-less' branch where the entire codebase has been re-written from scratch to remove the dependancy on [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

This project uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [URI.js](https://medialize.github.io/URI.js/), [`fetch` polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) and [YouTubePlayer](https://github.com/gajus/youtube-player)
